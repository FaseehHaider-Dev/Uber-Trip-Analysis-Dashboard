* 🧩 **Data Modeling** – Relationships established between trip data, date/time dimensions, vehicle types, and locations
* 📁 **File Format** – `.pbit` for development and `.png` for portfolio presentation

## 5. Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem
Ride-hailing platforms generate massive volumes of trip data daily, but without effective visualization, it becomes difficult to answer key business questions such as:
* When does rider demand peak during the day and week?
* Which vehicle types generate the highest bookings and revenue?
* How do trip patterns differ between day and night?
* Which locations contribute most to overall demand?
Without a centralized analytics dashboard, extracting insights from raw trip data is inefficient and time-consuming.

To provide a unified analytics solution that:
* Delivers a high-level overview of Uber trip performance
